From there, select a rep, and contact them directly using our amazing CELLULAR technology (ok, it's just a regular phone call...). 
Or email them if your social anxiety's got you dreading talking on the phone!

On each rep's page is a collection of articles from the New York Times. Never miss a thing!

In the future, we at Call hope to offer a calendar of upcoming elections, and easy links so you can register to vote straight from your smartphone. 
We know how hard it is these days to keep engaged, so we're working to make democracy as accessible as possible.
